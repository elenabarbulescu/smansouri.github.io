Albert Camus  was a French philosopher, author, dramatist, journalist, world federalist and political activist.
He was the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient in history.
His works include The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel.
Philosophically, Camus' views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. 
Some consider Camus' work to show him to be an existentialist, even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.
